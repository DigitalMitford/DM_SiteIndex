# siteIndex
a repository for development of the prosopography "site index" file serving <http://digitalmitford.org>. 
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3464076.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3464076) archives the current release and all previous releases of our prosopography data.

If you are here to update the Digital Mitford Site Index, please follow our instructions posted in [howToUpdateSI.md](howToUpdateSI.md)

The following directories in this repository help to organize work on adding new site index entries and editing the complete site index:

* **si_Add_IP** (for working on draft `si_Add` files before they are ready for sharing with the project team)
* **si_Add_Staged** (A "staging area" or sharing `si_Add` files with the team so the new xml:ids are available for schema checking. NOTE: This holds a catalogue.xml file which must be updated when new files are staged here.)
* **si_Full_IP** (a work space for editing the full site index file.)
* **si_Full_Staged** (A "staging area" for sharing a final draft of the full site index file, prior to public release.)
* **Template_si_Add** (Stores the current `si_Add` template files for compiling new entries from back lists for the Site Index.)
* **schemas** (Holds the schema files for validating/checking/guiding encoding for the si files.)
* **xslt** (Holds XSLT files for alphabetically sorting and other processing for SI files) 
* **old** (old files of any kind no longer in use, of archival value only)
