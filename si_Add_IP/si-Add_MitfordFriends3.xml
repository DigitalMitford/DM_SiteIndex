He later worked as a botanical illustrator at <placeName ref="#Kew_village">Kew</placeName> and exhibited at the Leeds Gallery.

                  <note resp="#lmw #ebb #scw">J. B. (John Berkeley) Monck was a Whig Member of Parliament for <placeName ref="#Reading_city">Reading</placeName>, <date from="1820" to="1830">from 1820 to 1830</date>, and he frequently franked <persName ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</persName>'s letters. <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford</persName>'s letter to <persName ref="#Elford_SirWm">Sir William Elford</persName> of <date when="1820-03-20">20 March 1820</date> describes the election of Monck, describing him in context with a shoemaker who brought him from France: <quote><persName ref="#Monck_JB">Mr. Monck</persName> an opposition man of large fortune brought from <placeName ref="#France">France</placeName> in a fit of patriotism by our celebrated shoemaker &amp; Patriot <persName>Mr. Warry</persName>.</quote> Monck was also the author of <title>General Reflections on the System of the Poor Laws</title> (<date when="1807">1807</date>), in which he argued for a gradual approach to abolishing the Poor Laws, and for the reform of workhouses. Dr. Webb's research suggests that <quote>celebrated shoemaker</quote> is Mr. Warry, possibly Joseph <!-- scw: See William Silver Darter [An Octogenarian], who names Warry of Minster Street, "an active liberal," as the person who was sent to France (41), although he says it was the 1812 election. See also the Monthly Magazine 12 (1801): 174 obituary for a Joseph Warry, boot and shoemaker of Reading, for 1801, which suggests the possibility that Mr. Warry may be his son who took over the business. Coles also puzzles over the name in one of Mitford's letters. --> John Berkeley (J.B.)
