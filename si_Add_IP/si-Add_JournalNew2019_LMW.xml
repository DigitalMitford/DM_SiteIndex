                   <p>A lifelong friend of <persName ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</persName>
                      who knew her from their childhood in the 1790s, Harness launched the first
                      major effort to collect and edit Mitford’s letters into a series of volumes,
                      which was completed by his assistant, <persName ref="#Lestrange">Alfred Guy
                         Kingan L’Estrange</persName> a year after Harness’s death, and published
                      as <title ref="#Lestrange_Letters">The Life of Mary Russell Mitford, Related
                         in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends</title>. This collection
                      was originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the
                      publishers, to Harness’s distress.</p>
                   <p>Harness and <persName ref="#Byron">Byron</persName> were also friends from
                      their schooling at Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harness’s experience of
                      a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered
                      dedicating <bibl>the first two cantos of <title level="m">Childe Harold’s
                         Pilgrimage</title>
                      </bibl> to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harness’s reputation as
                      he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged
                      Mitford’s playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of
                      the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over
                      prose. When <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">William Macready</persName> was
                      attacked in <bibl corresp="#Stage">an anonymous Blackwood’s Magazine piece
                         in 1825</bibl> for his demands and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to
                      <title ref="#Rienzi">Rienzi</title>, Macready assumed that Harness was
                      the author of the anonymous piece, though in <date when="1839">1839</date>
                      after many years of distance, Harness assured Macready in person that he was
                      not the writer, though he may have shared word of the poor treatment his
                      friend had endured.</p>
                   <p>William Harness was the son of John
                      Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on
                      April 13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from
                      Christ’s College, Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire
                      (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816). He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit
                      Street, London and minister and lecturer at St. Anne’s in Soho. He was Boyle
                      lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead from 1828 to 1844. In
                      1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including a
                      biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge
                      for the study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays
                      and reviews, some for the <title ref="#QuarterlyRev_per">Quarterly Review</title>. From 1844 to 1847 he was
                      minister of Brompton Chapel in London. He undertook to raise the funds to
                      build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge, in the parish of St.
                      Margaret’s Westminster, which opened in 1849, and he then became perpetual curate of
                      that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at 3 Hyde Park
                      Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister <persName ref="#Harness_Mary">Mary Harness</persName>
                      and his first cousin <persName>Jemima Harness</persName>, daughter of his uncle William. He died
                      while on a visit to one of his former curates in
                      Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death he living at the same address at 3
                      Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath.</p>Sources: <bibl>

The tree bears showy white flower spikes in the spring and develops spiky green fruits that contain a large tan and brown seed or nut, called a conker or horse-chestnut. In the UK, children collect the nuts for a game called conkers. They are members of the soapberry and lychee family and unrelated to other chestnut trees, which are members of the beech family.

Dahlias are native to Mexico and central America and were first imported into continental Europe in the 1780s and thence to England in the early nineteenth century. The first illustration appeared in the <title level="s">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</title> in 1804 and dahlias became fashionable garden flowers in England by the 1820s. In Mitford's time, both single- and double-flowered varieties were propagated, and varieties were largely classified by flower color. Dahlia tubers are susceptible to frost, and must have their tubers dug over winter and replanted, if they are not grown in greenhouses.</note>

                  <note resp="#lmw">Bushy flowering garden plant grown primarily for its decorative seed pods, rather than for its flowers. White or violet flowers give way to disc-shaped seedpods, which shed their fleshy outer covering as they ripen to reveal a translucent inner membrane which may persist on the plant through winter. The dried stems and pods are used in flower arranging. The Latin name refers to the moon-shaped seed pods. Common names in many languages refer to the pods' likeness to coins; it is called <soCalled>silver dollar</soCalled> or <soCalled>money plant</soCalled> and other, similar names.</note>
