                     Perrault worked in various government secretarial roles, including as secretary
                     to the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres. He was elected to the
                     prestigious Academie francaise in <date when="1671">1671</date>. He advised on
                     the design of the Aesop's Fables fountains in the labyrinth at the Palace of
                     Versailles, and the Colonade section of the Louvre. He wrote treatises on
                     painting and theater, and became an influential advocate for modern authors
                     against those who held to strict classical standards of writing in the debate
                     around the Moderns versus the Ancients. He began writing fairy tales after he
                     was pushed out of his government position and subsequently lost his
                     pension.</note>
                  <note resp="#scw">Charles Perrault is today best known as the inventor of the
                     modern fairy tale. Born into a wealthy family, Perrault spent his career as a
                     secretary in the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres. He also worked in
                     various capacities within the court of Louis XIV to promote the King's
                     projects. He was a prominent advocate for the Modern side in the debate between
                     the Ancients and the Moderns in excellence in the arts, and a distinguished art
                     critic. In <date when="1671">1671</date>, he was elected to the
                        <foreign>Academie francaise</foreign>. After he was forcibly retired from
                     the court by one of his rivals, and denied his government pension, he turned to
                     writing. He published an epic poem, then, in <date when="1697">1697</date>
                     composed a collection of fairy tales under the name of his youngest son, Pierre
                     Darmancourt, entitled <title level="m">Tales and Stories of the Past with
                        Morals</title>. This collection of stories, drawn from previous literary
                     collections and from French folk tales, featured tales that became classics,
                     such as <title level="a">Little Red Riding Hood</title>, <title level="a"
                        >Cinderella; or the Little Glass Slipper</title>, <title level="a"
                        >Bluebeard</title>, and <title level="a">Sleeping Beauty</title>. It also
                     introduced the character of Mother Goose. The volume went through numerous
                     editions, translations, and adaptations. By Mitford's time, Perrault's tales
                     were recognized and published as stories for children, despite their sometimes
                     racy themes.</note>

                  <note resp="#scw">Smart was a prolific writer and translator of religious,
                     lyrical, and satirical verse. He was an acquaintance of <persName
                        ref="#Pope_Alex">Alexander Pope</persName> (whose <title>Ode to St.
                        Cecilia</title> he translated into Latin), <persName ref="#Johnson">Samuel

                        Collins</persName>, all of whom expressed admiration for his work. After
                     attending Cambridge and becoming praelector of Philosophy and keeper of the
                     common chest in <date when="1745">1745</date>, Smart began to write poetry and
                     plays, but also to accumulate debts that would follow him for the rest of his
                     life. He began contributing to the magazine <title level="m">The
                        Student</title> under the pseudonym <persName type="pseudo">Ebenezer
                        Pentweazle</persName>. As a result of debt and a struggle with mental
                     illness, he lost his place at Cambridge. Smart had met and married the
                     step-daughter of <persName ref="#Newbery_John">John Newbery</persName>, who at
                     the time was part-owner with his wife of the <title level="m"

                        >Newbery</persName> employed Smart to produce material for his publishing
                     and advertising ventures, including a periodical entitled <title level="m">The
                        Midwife; or the Old Woman's Magazine</title>. <persName ref="#Newbery_John"
                        >Newbery</persName> also published Smart's first major work, <title
                        level="m">Poems on Several Occasions</title>, which included his lengthy
                     georgic, <title>The Hop Garden</title>. Smart also produced a prose translation
                     of <persName ref="#Horace">Horace</persName>'s works. In <date when="1763"
                        >1763</date>, Smart again suffered a bout of mental illness which took the
                     form of a sort of religious mania, and was confined to an asylum. During his
                     confinement, he composed his most famous works, <title level="a">Song to
                        David</title> and <title level="a">Jubilate Agno</title>. He died in the
                     king's bench prison, where he had been imprisoned for debt. His widow,
                        <persName>Anna Maria Smart</persName> and daughter, <persName>Mary Anne

                     that her son order Psyche to fall in love with the ugliest man in the world.
                     Cupid refused and loved Psyche himself, visiting her only by night and
                     commanding that she not look at him. Eventually, Psyche broke Cupid's rule and
                     lit a lamp to look upon his face. For this disloyalty, Cupid abandoned her and
                     Psyche wandered through the world in search of her lover. Eventually she was
                     reunited with Cupid and made immortal by Jupiter."

                     presence in the Iliad. It is also in the Aeneid, as the Stygian Elm. Virgil
                     refers to a Roman superstition that elms were trees of ill-omen because their
                     fruit seemed to have no value. Two elm-motifs have risen from classical
                     literature: the 'Paradisal elm' motif, representing pastoral idylls, and the
                     'Elm and Death' motif. Many references to elm from the Renaissance onwards fit
                     one of these two categories. The elm also holds political significance. The
                     cutting of the elm was a diplomatic altercation between the Kings of France and
                     England in 1188. In England, after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the 'Dutch
                     Elm' hybrid was planted and become popular with enthusiasts o the new political
                     order. Furthermore, the 'Liberty Tree' was an American white elm in Boston. In
                     1775, the British felled it, and the Americans planted 'Liberty Elms' and sewed
                     elm symbols on to their reolutionary flags.</note>--> </item>

                     about five years old when the plague broke out, so it is unlikely that the

                     taken as a genuine eyewitness account, despite the verisimilitude of the text.
                     Defoe may have consulted the journals of his uncle, Henry Foe, the H.F. of the

                     of which were composed for the book itself, White describes his observations of
                     local natural surroundings, flora, fauna, and geologic formation in minute
                     detail. These observations were carefully prepared from notes White took over
                     time, and were meant to be a scientific record of the natural phenomena under
                     discussion, coupled with an assessment of the social conditions of the area.
                     The book was immensely successful, and is considered an early example of
                     ecological exploration. It was a favorite book of <persName ref="#MRM"
