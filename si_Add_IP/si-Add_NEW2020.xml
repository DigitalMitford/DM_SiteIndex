            <note type="bio">Rebecca Parker is pursuing an M.A. in Digital Humanities at Loyola University in Chicago. She graduated with a B.A. in English Literature and
               Social Sciences from the <ref target="http://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg</ref>, where she has worked as an
               assistant for the <ref target="http://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/digital-humanities/center-digital-text">Center for the Digital Text</ref>. She is currently working on a digital
               archive of her own. Her project, <ref target="http://nelson.newtfire.org/">The
                  Restoration of Nell Nelson</ref>, started in spring 2014 as research for her
               capstone thesis in history. The Nell Nelson archive intends to restore the
               importance of a female investigative reporter that exposed the harmful effects
               of industrialization in Chicago at the turn of the twentieth century. Parker’s
               interest in Digital Humanities stemmed from her involvement on the Digital
               Mitford Project working as <ref target="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/">Dr.
                  Beshero-Bondar</ref>’s Green Scholar. She is helping to prepare a digital edition of Mary Russell Mitford’s journal of 1819-1823.<!--Rebecca is an active member of <ref target="http://www.english.org/sigmatd/">Sigma Tau Delta</ref> and <ref target="http://www.phikappaphi.org/">Phi Kappa Phi</ref> on her

                   <p>A lifelong friend of <persName ref="#MRM">Mary Russell Mitford</persName>
                      who knew her from their childhood in the 1790s, Harness launched the first
                      major effort to collect and edit Mitford’s letters into a series of volumes,
                      which was completed by his assistant, <persName ref="#Lestrange">Alfred Guy
                         Kingan L’Estrange</persName> a year after Harness’s death, and published
                      as <title ref="#Lestrange_Letters">The Life of Mary Russell Mitford, Related
                         in a Selection from her Letters to her Friends</title>. This collection
                      was originally intended to be six volumes, but was cut back to three by the
                      publishers, to Harness’s distress.</p>
                   <p>Harness and <persName ref="#Byron">Byron</persName> were also friends from
                      their schooling at Harrow, as Byron sympathized with Harness’s experience of
                      a disabled foot, crushed in an accident in early childhood. Byron considered
                      dedicating <bibl>the first two cantos of <title level="m">Childe Harold’s
                         Pilgrimage</title>
                      </bibl> to Harness, but refrained so as not to taint Harness’s reputation as
                      he was taking orders as an Anglican curate. Harness admired and encouraged
                      Mitford’s playwrighting in particular, and she commented that he was one of
                      the few of her friends who thought she should prioritize the drama over
                      prose. When <persName ref="#Macready_Wm">William Macready</persName> was
                      attacked in <bibl corresp="#Stage">an anonymous Blackwood’s Magazine piece
                         in 1825</bibl> for his demands and rudeness to Mitford over revisions to
                      <title ref="#Rienzi">Rienzi</title>, Macready assumed that Harness was
                      the author of the anonymous piece, though in <date when="1839">1839</date>
                      after many years of distance, Harness assured Macready in person that he was
                      not the writer, though he may have shared word of the poor treatment his
                      friend had endured.</p>
                   <p>William Harness was the son of John
                      Harness, M.D. and Sarah Dredge; he was baptized at Whitchurch, Hampshire on
                      April 13, 1790. He received his B.A. in 1812 and his M.A. in 1816 from
                      Christ’s College, Cambridge. He served as curate at Kelmeston, Hampshire
                      (1812) and Dorking (1814-1816). He was preacher at Trinity Chapel, Conduit
                      Street, London and minister and lecturer at St. Anne’s in Soho. He was Boyle
                      lecturer in London (1822) and was curate at Hampstead from 1828 to 1844. In
                      1825, he published an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare, including a
                      biography; his friends would later endow a prize in his name at Cambridge
                      for the study of Shakespearean literature. He also authored numerous essays
                      and reviews, some for the <title ref="#QuarterlyRev_per">Quarterly Review</title>. From 1844 to 1847 he was
                      minister of Brompton Chapel in London. He undertook to raise the funds to
                      build the church of All Saints, Knightsbridge, in the parish of St.
                      Margaret’s Westminster, which opened in 1849, and he then became perpetual curate of
                      that congregation. At the 1851 and 1861 censuses, he lived at 3 Hyde Park
                      Terrace, Westminster St. Margaret, Middlesex, with his sister <persName ref="#Harness_Mary">Mary Harness</persName>
                      and his first cousin <persName>Jemima Harness</persName>, daughter of his uncle William. He died
                      while on a visit to one of his former curates in
                      Battle, Sussex. At the time of his death he living at the same address at 3
                      Hyde Park Terrace; he is buried in Bath.</p>Sources: <bibl>

Doves carry symbolic significance in both the Old and New Testaments of the Hebrew Bible: in Genesis in the story of Noah and the ark as a symbol of peace and deliverance, in the Song of Songs as a term of endearment, and in Matthew as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Doves were also acceptable burnt offerings and came to symbolize peace in early Christianity. Later literary and artistic references often draw on this association of doves with peace, deliverance, and spiritual gifts, and are representations of the rock dove, which is highly variable in color, ranging from white to shades of grey and pale brown.</note>

					<note resp="#tfb #lmw">The so-called <soCalled>English elm</soCalled> is a deciduous tree with serrated leaves, known in Europe as the <soCalled>field elm</soCalled>, introduced into England from Spain in the 16th century. Before Dutch elm disease decimated the population in the 20th century, mature elm trees were a prominent feature of mixed deciduous forests and were also frequently used in landscape gardening. In England, elms were found in mixed forests with oak and ash, often near rivers. While populations still exist, they do not grow to mature size, and so immature elms are today mainly found in hedgerows. Because of its resistance to rot, elm was frequently used to construct medieval water pipes as well as piers, jetties, and lock gates. Because of its resistance to splitting, it was also used to make chair seats, coffins, wagon wheel hubs, and ancient world bows. During the enclosure movement, elms were plants in hawthorn hedges, and avenues and groves of elms were popular features of 18th- and 19th-century landscape gardening. Wych elm (ulmus montana), also called witch hazel or Scots elm, is also native to the UK. Ancient Roman literature spoke of a <soCalled>marriage</soCalled> between the elm and the vine, in which the elm represented the husband, because of their practice of planting elms in vineyards to support grapevines; in British literature, this motif appears most frequently as elm and ivy. The ancient Greek tradition of planting elms on graves has also given rise to a <soCalled>elm-and-death</soCalled> motif. They are also frequently mentioned in classical pastoral poetry, where their cool shade is praised as paradisal.

It is known in English as the common bluebell or simply bluebell, a name which is used in Scotland to refer to the harebell, Campanula rotundifolia. In spring, H. non-scripta produces a nodding, one-sided inflorescence of 5–12 tubular, sweet-scented violet–blue flowers, with strongly recurved tepals, and 3–6 long, linear, basal leaves. H. non-scripta is particularly associated with ancient woodland where it may dominate the understorey to produce carpets of violet–blue flowers in <soCalled>bluebell woods</soCalled>, but also occurs in more open habitats in western regions. It is protected under UK law, and in some other parts of its range. A related species, H. hispanica has also been introduced to the British Isles and hybridises with H. non-scripta to produce intermediates known as H. × massartiana.<!-- LMW:  MRM mentions a wild hyacinth in Violeting sketch. --><!-- REV --></note>

Dahlias are native to Mexico and central America and were first imported into continental Europe in the 1780s and thence to England in the early nineteenth century. The first illustration appeared in the <title level="s">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</title> in 1804 and dahlias became fashionable garden flowers in England by the 1820s. In Mitford's time, both single- and double-flowered varieties were propagated, and varieties were largely classified by flower color. Dahlia tubers are susceptible to frost, and must have their tubers dug over winter and replanted, if they are not grown in greenhouses.</note>
