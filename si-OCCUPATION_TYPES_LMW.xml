                  <!-- OCCUPATION TAGS IN PLAY  -->
                  <!-- General principles:  Use the correct 19th c. term where appropriate. Stick to the standard/common terms used in other reference works (WorldCat/VIAF/encyclopedias and Wikipedia). Use a general category and a more specific occupation when possible (ie, use "literary" and "journalist" and do not use "journalism"). Put specific JOB TITLES under roleName, not under occupation. Avoid getting too specific and use a single word whenever possible (ie, use painter, not portrait painter; use patron, not art patron or patron of the arts; one exception to the one word rule is "theater manager"). Avoid diminuative forms: ie, use actor, not actress. -->
                  
                  <!-- INCONSISTENCIES and ONE-OFFS to consider correcting:
                  Jurist: use legal? Do we need as separate from judge and magistrate?
                  journalism: use literary and journalist
                  writer/author:  use literary and additional tags for genres
                  scientist: use naturalist or appropriate field name (ie, chemist)
                  botanist/ornithologist: can we put these under naturalist?
                  museum curator: can we put under antiquarian?
                  diplomat/ambassador: could we put both under diplomat, and list the ambassadorial title under roleName?
                  gambler: is this a profession? I think in the Regency it was, in a way.
                  religion: use clergy
                  clergyman: use clergy
                  warrior: use military and appropriate roleName for military title
                  academic: use educator or scholar or both
                  banking: use banker
                  king/queen: use monarch
                  princess/nobility/aristocracy: use courtier
                  doctor: use medical and correct term
                  senator: use politician plus title
                  amateur painter: use artist and painter
                  court historian: use historian
                  art collector:  use patron?
                  portrait painter, history painter: use painter
                  draftsman: use artist? (I don't like draftsperson.)
                  theater patron/literary patron/arts patron/patron of the arts: use patron
                  pioneer: use explorer or traveller
                  agricultural experimenter: use inventor or agronomist
                  shopkeeper: use merchant
                  political reformer: use reformer
                  songwriter/lyricist/librettist: use musician and composer
                  theatrical production designer: use production designer and theater
                  republican/rebel/condottiero: use politician or government?
                  civil servant: use government or administrator or clerk
                  assassin/regicide/prisoner of war: put in the note and not under occupation. Could tag regicides of Charles I with orgName or event
                  -->
                  
                  <!-- Issues of categorizing and what we might want to do with the data:
                  There seems to be no way to add a type="trades" or anything similar that would designate a social class, to the <occupation> tag directly.
                  From the TEI guidelines it appeared that we would need to set a schema that might categorize those, or we could continue to do what we've been doing and just add a more general <occupation> tag to the specific one.  ie, use <occupation>working class<occupation> <occupation>trades<occupation> <occupation>blacksmith</occupation>.
                  
                  Some categories to consider, not currently in use: TRADES, SERVICE, THEATER, EDUCATION (although we've used EDUCATOR). 
                  
                  Possible occupation to add:  housekeeper or keeping house (even for those women not professional servants): this is a census category in the 19th c., when censuses start collecting "occupation" data. ie, capture invisible labor categories.
                  
                  What not to do: I don't think that we should use a social class designator, like aristocrat or royalty or landed gentry, should be used as an "occupation." These are more readily and accurately captured under the people's <roleName>, and really comprise a number of occupations, depending on the individual. ie, government, courtier, legal (magistracy), philanthropy, farming, literary, artist . . . .
