                     nearly bankrupted him, before she fatally poisoned herself in August 1813.

                  <note resp="#scw #lmw #rnes">Gilbert White obtained deacon's orders in 1746 and was fully ordained in 1749; he held several curacies in Hampshire and Wiltshire. From 1784 until his death he held the post of curate of Selborne, Hampshire. White's most famous and widely-cited book, <bibl><title level="m">The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</title></bibl> was admired by <persName ref="#MRM">Mitford </persName> for its careful observations of nature. The book is cited by the narrator of <title ref="#Our_Village1st_ed">Our Village</title> in the introductory <title level="a">Our Village sketch</title> as well as in <title level="a">Frost and Thaw</title>.<!--scw: I am sure we will come across his name in other sketches-->. An important amateur natural historian, botanist, and ornithologist, he emphasized the interrelatedness of plants and animals within an environment in ways that foreshadow modern ecology. Because of his botanical work, his name has been accorded a standard abbreviation for citation purposes in the <bibl>International Code of Botanic Nomenclature</bibl>.
