                  <note resp="#lmw">Military commander and political leader. During the French Revolution and Revolutionary Wars, Napoleon rose to prominence as a military leader. He engineered a coup in 1799 that brought him to power as First Consul of France and then as Napoleon I, Emperor of the French (from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815). As Emperor, he led France against a series of European military coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars, building an empire that extended over most of continental Europe until its collapse in 1815. In spring 1814, the Allies captured Paris and forced Napoleon to abdicate, exiling him to the island of Elba and restoring the Bourbons to power. Less than a year later, Napoleon escaped from Elba and retook control of France, only to suffer defeat by the Allies at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British then exiled him to the island Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he remained until his death in 1821. He is celebrated as one of Europe's greatest military commanders and as the disseminator of the system of laws known as the Napoleonic Code.</note>

Rienzo rose from humble origins as the son of a washerwoman and a tavern keeper to lead a bloodless coup against <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName>â€™s aristocracy through his powerful oratory in the 1340s. <rs type="event">He named himself in <date when="1347">1347</date> the Tribune of Rome</rs>, and he aimed to restore <placeName ref="#Rome">Rome</placeName> to its classical glory as the capitol of a united Italian nation and empire. Although he would lose power within a year to vengeful barons united in opposition against him, Rienzo became legendary for his meteoric career, his humiliation of bullying overlords, and his rule dedicated to the restoring the dignity of Roman people in a time of chaos and confusion. His contemporary, the poet <persName ref="#Petrarch">Petrarch</persName>, admired Rienzo as a man of humble origins who could unite the Roman people with his inspiring oratory and construct a new regime to punish abusers of power.</note>

An important amateur natural historian, botanist, and ornithologist, he emphasized the interrelatedness of plants and animals within an environment in ways that foreshadow modern ecology. Because of his botanical work, his name has been accorded a standard abbreviation for citation purposes in the <bibl>International Code of Botanic Nomenclature</bibl>.
