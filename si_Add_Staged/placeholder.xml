      <body><!-- Updated 2023-07-25 2021-09-06: ebb: This is just a placeholder file to ensure the directory isn't empty. 
         Lacking a file to reference in the catalogue.xml seems to cause problems for the Mitford ODD schema. 
         DELETE this file and remove from the catalogue.xml as soon as we have a new set of entries for SI_Add_Staged.
         
         This entry was from an old SI-Add file from 2021 (si-Add_MitfordFriends3.xml) and represents an old update to the Haydon entry 
         (it's already in the SI now).
